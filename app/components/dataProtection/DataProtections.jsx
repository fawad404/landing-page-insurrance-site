                    <p className="mt-2">You can generally view our website without providing personal data. We only store the website from which you came to our offer, the name of your Internet Service Provider, which websites you have visited within our online offer, and the date and duration of your visit. For this purpose, small files (so-called cookies) are stored in the memory of your computer during your visit. These are so-called temporary session cookies (for permanent cookies, see below under section 9). The relevant data is stored on servers of our service provider Host Europe GmbH, Hansestraße 111 - 51149 Cologne. The session cookies are automatically deleted as soon as you close your browser window. We create a so-called session ID for internal statistical purposes using the session cookies.

The term timestamp refers to a value in a defined format that assigns a time to an event (such as sending or receiving a message, modifying data, etc.). The purpose of a timestamp is to clearly indicate when which events have occurred to people or computers.
